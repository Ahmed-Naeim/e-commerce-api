* **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
* **Password Encryption**: Uses `bcrypt.js` to hash and protect user passwords.
* **Product Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for products.
* **Cart Management**: Users can add, update, and view products in their shopping cart.
* **Order Management**: Users can place orders, and admins can manage them.
* **Admin Controls**: Middleware to protect routes, ensuring only authorized admins can manage products, users, and orders.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### **Prerequisites**

* Node.js installed on your machine.
* MongoDB installed and running (or a MongoDB Atlas connection string).

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Ahmed-Naeim/e-commerce-api.git](https://github.com/Ahmed-Naeim/e-commerce-api.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd e-commerce-api
    ```

3.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:
    ```env
    MONGO_URL=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
    JWT_SEC=YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY
    ```

5.  **Run the server:**
    * For development (with auto-reloading):
        ```sh
        npm run dev
        ```
    * For production:
        ```sh
        npm start
